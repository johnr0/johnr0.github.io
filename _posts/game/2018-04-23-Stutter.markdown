Inside of a brain of a boy who stutter, you experience the boy’s tragic, yet hopeful school life.

While feeling the boy’s emotion from the closest perspective, you help him say words, by shooting words he wants to say.

This game is the mixture of a simple FPS and an text-based adventure, which makes you sympathize with the boy, and help him through struggles.

Co-developed with my friends, JaeHeung Han, Jihye Kim from LoadComplete, and JungGun Ahn also from LoadComplete as a Ludum Dare Game Jam project. Developed in three days.
