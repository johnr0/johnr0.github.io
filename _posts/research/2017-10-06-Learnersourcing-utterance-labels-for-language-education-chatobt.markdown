When building a chatbot, failure to cope with user's input properly is always a problem, because it deters further interaction with users. Though failures can be solved with adequate amount of data and accurate labels, it would be hard to get information about error causing inputs from learners, because error itself preclude users from using it more. In this project, we build a chatbot system that enables chat interaction and data collection on error causing inputs simultaneously in language learning situations. While learners use the chatbot for language learning, when the chatbot makes an error in understanding user input, the error situation is turned to a learning opportunity. In the form of quizzes, learners check whether how the chatbot should have reacted exist in a set of candidate chatbot outputs and label their own input with the proper output if it exists. If not, learners can label it as 'unexpected', which can be later dealt by chatbot developer. Collected data can be utilized to improve chatbot, making it more robust.
