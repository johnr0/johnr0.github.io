Narratological analysis needs to be done prior to narratology research, which interpret narrative texts. Even though it is majorly done manually by narrative researchers, analysis at scale is difficult to be done with limited number of researchers. Therefore, we are trying to enable narratological analysis with human computation at scale. However, expertise level of non-expert crowds and context dependent nature of narrative text can be obstacles in successful analysis. To solve those problems we are implementing collaborative and communicative crowdsourcing between experts and non-experts. In the narrative analysis system, experts become managers, directing crowd workers and aggregating work results to convey expert knowledge and global view of the task. Non-experts can also communicate spontaneously, by asking questions on global view and expert knowledge they necessary. By designing collaborative system that effectively conveys ideas of crowds and experts, we envision a crowdsourcing system that leverages both of experts and non-expert crowds.
