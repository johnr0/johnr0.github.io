There is growing interest in intelligent systems, and the system that understands emotion and intention of the user is yet to be achieved. However, establishing such a system is difficult due to lack of labeled data which the system can train on. Microtask-based crowdsourcing has been a scalable way to gather annotation on data, however, when applying crowdsourcing to annotating videos, there is a problem that the overall context in videos can disappear by segmenting them into microtask. We research on ways to conveying the overall context of the video to each workers while segmenting tasks into pieces, with workflows that mixes top-down and bottom-up approach and embedding of machine computation in workflows.
