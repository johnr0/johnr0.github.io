Instantaneous crowdsourcing prefetches tasks for possible future states in advance and use the pre-collected task results when one of the future is reached. It can be leveraged in solving real-world problems that require accelerated human capabilities, like coping with the rapidly happening accidents. However, real-world is complex, and there can be an enormous amount of possible future states. We are investigating ways to use human prediction capability to minimize the number of critical futures and make the instantaneous crowdsourcing more feasible in real-world problems.
