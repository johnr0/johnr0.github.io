<h3>HCI Researcher</h3>
<p>I am John Joon Young Chung, a first-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html">CROMA Lab</a>, University of Michigan, working with Professor <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/">Walter Lasecki</a>. 
 My research area is focused on HCI, crowdsourcing, collaboration at scale, and AI. 
 I am interested in ways to leverage uncertain inputs from humans in the computing system. 
 For example, what is the optimal way to use estimation or prediction from humans to help AI better solve problems?
 How can we leverage them to make people better collaboratively learn?
 Problem domains that I am interested in include autonomous vehicles, human learning, creativity, online discussion, etc.

<h3>Music, Pixel Arts, and Games</h3>

In my free time, I play guitar and compose <a href="{{domain}}/music/">some tunes</a>. Recently, I started drawing pixel arts.
I used to enjoy video games, ranging from AAA games to experimental indie games, and also prototyped <a href="{{domain}}/game/">some games</a> with my friends.
