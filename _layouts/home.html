<h3>HCI Researcher</h3>
<p>I am John Joon Young Chung, a second-year Ph.D. student at, University of Michigan. </p>
  <!-- My research area is focused on HCI, crowdsourcing, and AI.  -->
<p>
  AI systems started to be deployed in real-world, social settings, but real-world is constantly changing with complex social interactions.
  Within these settings, AI systems need to adapt to changing environment, but this process has required involvement of experts, which can be slow and result in undesirable outcome.
  With this motivation, I build tools to empower people and community to collaboratively build and design their own intelligent and interactive artifacts.
